DO NOT USE ONYX ON THESE FOR ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ARE CONVERTING TO PS3. THEY WILL WORK ON RB3/RB2/RB1.
CH/PS converting is largely out of the scope of this project, do not bring up any issues about converting to these formats as they just flat out might not work.
Read onyx.txt for more information.
Welcome to the FEStoRB repo.

These are beautifully recreated tracks from Fortnite Festival, recreated painstakingly for RB format.
Below is a list of all songs currently completed. (Hand authored) 

(All other songs have a basic Onyx conversion, located in the basic conversions folder)

*Note that RB1/RB2 cons will still load in RB3 just fine. Do not attempt to convert to an RB3 con yourself, you will break the con.*
